          In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
          humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of
          additional background information.

          In writing, a section of content that is related to the current topic, but
          doesn't fit directly into the main flow of content so is presented nearby
          (often in a box off to the side.)

      <p>Here is a blockquote:</p>
      <blockquote
        cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
